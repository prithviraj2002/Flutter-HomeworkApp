# Problems I faced while building this app in flutter

1:  Connecting to the internet
    Connecting to the internet, making requests using api was cumbersome and 
    I had to look up to a lot of code and documentations online to implement it in the app.

2:  Handling JSON file
    After loading the json file from the api call made, I had to go through the steps to decoding the json file used, and instantiating the model classes accordingly.

3:  Live Data
    After connecting to the internet, next challenge was to load the data to the screen, and making the UI interact with the data. 

4:  Building the UI
    Learning the basic widgets to build a simple layout was easy, yet I had to dive deeper into scrollable widgets such as SingleChildScrollView and ListView to implement the designed functionality. Flutter official docs, and widget catalog was of great help here.
